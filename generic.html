							<p>My name is Thompson Longe. Born and raised in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. I graduated from the Federal University of Technology, Akure in 2017 with a Bachelor of Architecture, and it was then that I developed my love for architecture. My technical skills and style of design developed there, with a special focus on environmental development, historical preservation, and sustainable design.</p>
							<p>After graduating, I started working for Necham Engineering Services, where I was involved in designing lighting, construction, greenery, and water features for public green spaces like parks and greenways. I also gained useful experience in drafting design objectives and system design documents. My dedication to creative development set the standard for the environmental improvement of Engr Idowo Oluwole Crescent in Osogbo, resulting in a 50% increase in the area's property value. My career took off after this experience, and I was able to secure my first and highest paying position as a Site Architect at Skylight IAC Synergy Ltd. In this role, I was in charge of managing financial budgets, coordinating drawing specifications, and ensuring design accuracy and compliance, all of which increased team productivity by 40%.</p>
							<p>Building on this foundation, I joined a team of Five architects in 2020 to establish a construction and consulting firm, which we named IDR Construction and Consult. In this firm, I held the role of the Lead Architect, where I was responsible for directing the team on drafting detailed structural drawings for both residential and commercial development projects, and also managing client relations for multi-family housing projects.  I was able to contribute to an annual revenue spike of #100 million through strategic design and project management.</p>
						<p>I boast a comprehensive skillset in the following areas:</p>
						<p> •Technical Proficiency: AutoCAD, Revit, ArchiCAD, Sketchup Pro, MS Office Suite<br />
							•Design & Visualization: Adobe Creative Suite, Adobe Photoshop<br />
							•Project Management:  Site analysis, Architectural systems, Construction cost control, QC/QA management<br />
							•Communication & Collaboration: Team management, collaborative design processes<br />
							•Design Expertise: Commercial and Residential Building Design<br />
							•Additional Skills: Research and Multi-tasking</p>
							<p>I'm excited to work with a creative team where I can apply my abilities and support exceptional architectural projects.</p>
